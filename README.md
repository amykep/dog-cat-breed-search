### User Story

**AS** a future pet owner

**I WANT** to be able to search for a cat or dog breed

**THEN** be given a picture and facts about that breed

**SO** I can make better decisions about which pet is best for me

---

### Functionality

This project lets users search for a specific dog or cat breed. When a user enters a specific dog or cat breed, a random picture of that breed with some facts about it will populate the webpage. There are two error responses: one for breeds that we do not have yet/do not exist and when the user tries to do an empty search. The user also has the ability to look at previously searched breeds as well as clearing the previously searched breed history.
